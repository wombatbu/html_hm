        <p><b>Keira Christina Righton</b>[1] OBE (/<i>ˈkɪərə ˈnaɪtli/</i>; née <b>Knightley</b>, born 26 March 1985) is
            an English actress.[2]
            She has starred in both independent films and big-budget blockbusters, and is particularly noted for her
            roles in period dramas.
            Her accolades include two Empire Awards and nominations for two Academy Awards, three British Academy Film
            Awards,
            three Golden Globe Awards, one Screen Actors Guild Award and one Laurence Olivier Award. Knightley was
            appointed an OBE
            in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.[3]
        </p>
        <p>Born in London to actors Will Knightley and Sharman Macdonald, Knightley obtained an agent at age six, and
            initially
            worked commercials and television films. She appeared as Sabé, Padmé Amidala's handmaiden, in science
            fiction blockbuster
            Star Wars: <i>Episode I – The Phantom Menace</i> (1999). Despite her work, she struggled to break through
            until portraying a tomboy
            footballer in sports film <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> (2001). Knightley achieved global stardom with her
            portrayal of Elizabeth
            Swann in fantasy swashbuckler series Pirates of the Caribbean. In the same year, she appeared in the
            Christmas romantic comedy
            <i>Love Actually</i> (2003) and was labelled a promising teen star.
        <p>For her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet in the period romance Pride & Prejudice (2005), Knightley was nominated
            for the
            Academy Award for Best Actress. At age 20, she became the third-youngest Best Actress nominee at the time.
            Knightley
            starred in a series of further period pieces, portraying a complex love interest in Atonement (2007),
            tastemaker Georgiana
            Cavendish in The Duchess (2008), and the titular socialite in Anna Karenina (2012). She then forayed into
            contemporary dramas,
            appearing as an aspiring musician in <i>Begin Again</i> (2013) and a medical student in Jack Ryan: Shadow
            Recruit (2014).
            Knightley returned to historical films by playing cryptoanalyst <i>Joan Clarke in The Imitation Game</i>
            (2014), earning her
            a second round of Academy Award and BAFTA nominations, and starred as the eponymous belle époque writer in
            Colette (2018) to critical acclaim.
        </p>
        <p>On stage, Knightley has appeared in two West End productions: <i>The Misanthrope in 2009</i>, which earned
            her an Olivier
            Award nomination, and <i>The Children's Hour</i> in 2011. She also starred as the eponymous heroine in the
            2015 Broadway
            production of Thérèse Raquin. Knightley is known for her outspoken stance on social issues, and has worked
            extensively
            with Amnesty International, Oxfam, and Comic Relief. She is married to musician James Righton, with whom she
            has two daughters.
